// Barrel: Lakebase workflow scripts.
//
// The Consort-coupled project scaffolders (create-project, adopt-lakebase-project,
// adopt-sftdd) and the Consort command updater (update-commands) live in the
// Consort kit, not this package, so they are not
// re-exported here. The canonical owner files (env-file.ts, project-verify.ts)
// still export writeEnvFile / verifyHooks / verifyWorkflows / verifyProject.
