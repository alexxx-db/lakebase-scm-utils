//
// Resiliency: the ports are env-driven (E2E_BACKEND_PORT / E2E_CLIENT_PORT).
// run-tests.sh and CI pre-allocate FREE ports (scripts/port-utils.sh) and hand them
// in via those vars, so a stale server left on 8000/5173 by a prior run never makes
// webServer hard-fail with "port already used". When NOTHING hands them in — a direct
// `npx playwright test` (e.g. the build driver running a targeted spec, not through
// run-tests.sh) — resolve a free port HERE the SAME way, by sourcing that one shared
// free_port helper, so a direct run is just as collision-proof and never defaults onto
// a busy :8000 / :5173. One free-port owner (port-utils.sh), two entry points. The Vite
// proxy is pointed at the resolved backend port via VITE_PROXY_TARGET so /api + /health
