# NOTE: a per-cycle client AC-scope (vitest -t / playwright --grep from SFTDD_TEST_IDS) was tried and

# @T specs stops the FULL client suite from running per cycle, which is what detects SUPERSESSION — a
# prior test asserting an element the current story removed (e.g. S2 split the combined
# `tracking-not-tracked` cell into batch/serial). Without that in-cycle RED the driver never refactors
# the superseded test, so it surfaces LATER as a deploy-verify HALT instead of a smooth in-cycle
# refactor. The client Vitest is cheap (jsdom) and the expensive Playwright E2E is already cost-gated
# by cycle layer below, so the full per-cycle client run stays — it is load-bearing, not waste.
#
# EXCEPTION — #2 parallel-lane scope (gated): in a SCOPED-LANE drive (CONSORT_SCOPE_AC set, i.e. a
# parallel per-AC lane / the contract story's serial-first AC), the cross-story supersession is owned by
# the DETERMINISTIC hoist sweep, NOT by this reactive full-client-run. So there the client pass is scoped
# to THIS AC's @T specs (it must not re-run the cross-story suite + re-trigger supersession wave-by-wave
# on the lanes' critical path). FLEET drives (no CONSORT_SCOPE_AC) are UNCHANGED — full client suite,

# React SPA client E2E (Playwright). The client's end-to-end suite (client/tests/e2e/*.spec.ts) MUST run

# deferred to CI. Deferring it (the old "owned by CI" split) was a systemic FALSE GREEN: a client-UI AC
# greened off the backend + client-Vitest passing while its Playwright E2E never ran locally, so the Driver
# got NO RED, never built the UI, and the whole client-E2E class read green until CI caught it post-hoc.
# Run it HERE so the Driver gets an honest RED and builds the UI. The client playwright.config.ts's webServer
# boots the backend + SPA; a failing E2E fails the run (set -e). HARD STOP: E2E specs present with no
# client/package.json + playwright config to run them is itself a false GREEN - refuse, never silently skip
# the class. (The top-of-file orphan guard already covers the no-client/package.json case; this adds the
# "config missing" case and, above all, ACTUALLY RUNS the suite.)
#
# COST GATE (E2E is slow, so don't pay it on every per-cycle re-verify): the drive passes the current
# cycle's layer as CONSORT_CYCLE_LAYER. Run the client E2E only when it is RELEVANT - an E2E-layer cycle
# (CONSORT_CYCLE_LAYER=E2E) OR the layer is UNSET (the deploy-verify gate + any un-scoped full run). A
# non-E2E cycle (API/Infra backend work) SKIPS the client E2E - the driver gets its RED on the E2E-layer
# cycles that own the client UI, and the deploy gate re-runs the full suite. FAIL-SAFE: an unset layer
# RUNS the E2E (correct-but-heavier), so a missing/incorrect thread never degrades to a silent skip
# (false GREEN); the only way to skip is the drive EXPLICITLY naming a non-E2E layer.

# stale :8000 (e.g. a /deploy server whose `consort-deploy --stop` teardown
# didn't run) or :5173 can't hard-fail Playwright's webServer. Idempotent -
