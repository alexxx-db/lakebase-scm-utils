# ── Consort dashboard table-snapshot (dev/test/CI only) ─────────────────────

# dashboard's per-test table view. E2E (Playwright) specs mutate the DB THROUGH
# the app, so the app is the one process already connected to the branch — the
# E2E reporter calls this after each spec to record the DB state that spec left.
# Guarded by the PRESENCE of a `.consort/` dir at the project root: present in a
# dev/test/CI checkout but NOT in a packaged production app, so the route is
# simply absent in a real deploy — no env flag, no per-server wiring. Read-only,
# row-capped, identifier-validated.

# /health here, so client/dist does not exist) and a no-op for a server-rendered
# or API-only backend that has no client/. The catch-all matches every remaining
# GET path (client-side routing needs index.html on deep-link refresh), so it
# MUST stay last: register API routers above it.
